// REVIEW: We will be writing documentation today for the methods in this file that handles Model layer of our application. As an example, here is documentation for Article.prototype.toHtml(). You will provide documentation for the other methods in this file in the same structure as the following example. In addition, where there are TODO comment lines inside of the method, describe what the following code is doing (down to the next TODO) and change the TODO into a DONE when finished.

  // DONE: Creates a property called 'publishStatus' that will hold one of two possible values: if the article has been published (as indicated by the check box in the form in new.html), it will be the number of days since publication as calculated in the prior line; if the article has not been published and is still a draft, it will set the value of 'publishStatus' to the string '(draft)'
